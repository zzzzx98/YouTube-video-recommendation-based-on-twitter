##  Description of the repository:
This is our final project for ELEN6889, the instructor is Prof. Deepak Turaga, we designed YouTube video recommendation based on twitter.

##  Example commands to execute the code:
1. Please enter your Youtube API in the scripts.
2. We designed a front-end for the project, the front-end will read the input username and store it in a txt file, and then call our back-end program to get the result and display it on the front end. Of course, you can also run the backend program directly, please modify your input in input.txt, and then execute the following command to get the recommended results of our program running:
```bash
python search.py
```
